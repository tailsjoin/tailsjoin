# tailsjoin
## Script to install joinmarket and dependencies on Tails OS.

You must start Tails with "More options" setting in the beginning (Persistence is optional) and set an administrator password.

    cd /home/amnesia/Persistent (optional)
    git clone https://github.com/tailsjoin/tailsjoin
    cd tailsjoin
    ./tailsjoin.sh
    
Be aware, the script will prompt for the administrator password several times throughout.
